# construction-equipment

## Description

This repository stores the ShinyApp that I made as a project intended to record and manage construction equipment maintenance. This project uses a SQL database to store different construction equipment maintenance status. The goal of this project is to help construction managers keep track of equipment wear and tear in order to order the correct replacement parts or schedule appropriate maintenance.

## Requirements

This program requires R and RStudio, which can be downloaded and installed
through the following links:

### R

### RStudio

## One Time Install

Go to setup.R and `CTRL`+`A` and then `CTRL`+`ENTER` the entire R script to install all the packages. It may ask you to restart, just keep saying yes until all the packages are installed.
